we will run the GUI application with Kivy and the model script, we need to install the necessary dependencies.  

Here are the primary dependencies we need:

1. Kivy: The main GUI framework used in the example. You can install it using pip:
    
    ```
    Copy code
    pip install kivy
    
    ```
    
2. Transformers: A library for state-of-the-art natural language processing models. You can install it using pip:
    
    ```
    Copy code
    pip install transformers
    
    ```
    
3. Torch: The PyTorch library for deep learning. You can install it using pip:
    
    ```
    Copy code
    pip install torch
    
    ```
    
4. Pillow: A library for image processing. It's required by Kivy for handling images. You can install it using pip:
